Started from early 2000s, Professor [[http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/teacher_intro.asp?userid=75][Shiu-Chun Wong]] organized several reading
seminars on mathematics for undergraduate students at Zhejiang University. Many
students were benefited from these seminars. Since Prof. Wong's retirement in
2014, the seminars have terminated running. This site records some syllabi of
these seminars, and the contact information of the students who had participated
the seminars.
