Beginning in the early 2000s, Professor Shiu-Chun Wong organized several reading seminars on mathematics for undergraduate students at Zhejiang University. Many students benefited from these seminars. However, since Prof. Wong's retirement in 2014, the seminars have ceased. This website contains syllabi from these seminars, as well as contact information for students who participated.
