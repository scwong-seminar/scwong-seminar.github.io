#+title: SÃ©minaire Shiu-Chun Wong


Beginning in the early 2000s, Professor Shiu-Chun Wong (August 29,
1949 --- April 15, 2024) organized a series of mathematics reading
seminars for undergraduate students at Zhejiang University. These
seminars were highly beneficial for many students. After Prof. Wong's
retirement in 2014, the seminars were discontinued. This website
preserves the syllabi from those seminars and includes contact
information for the participating students.
