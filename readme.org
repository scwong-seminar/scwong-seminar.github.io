#+title: SÃ©minaire Shiu-Chun Wong

Beginning in the early 2000s, Professor Shiu-Chun Wong (August 29,
1949 --- April 15, 2024) organized several reading seminars on
mathematics for undergraduate students at Zhejiang University.  Many
students benefited from these seminars. However, since Prof. Wong's
retirement in 2014, the seminars have ceased.  This website contains
syllabi from these seminars, as well as contact information for
students who participated.
