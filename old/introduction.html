<h2>For Freshmen and New-comers</h2>
<p>Objectives of the seminar</p>
<ul> 
  <li>To get acquainted with abstract ideas and the abstract ways of thinking in mathematics.</li>
  <li>To learn how to express mathematical ideas precisely and lucidly.</li>
  <li>To learn how to self-study.</li>
  <li>To learn how to communicate mathematically and exchange ideas with others.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTICE</p>
<ul> 
  <li>The seminars are mostly offered to students who want to study pure mathematics in the future.</li>
  <li>Some certain seminars contains topics which serve as the mathematical background of other subjects such as physics and theoretic computer science. Students from different majors are welcomed.</li>
  <li>Be sure to contact the coordinator beforehand to make sure what is the content and objectivity of the seminar.</li>

<p>On the presentations</p>
 
  <p>1. Each presentation should be meticulously prepared, not only by the speaker, but also by the audience (in order to understand the talk). </p>
  <p>2. Because of the time limit, you have to tailor the contents. Focus on the most central and essential ideas and leave out the secondary stuffs.</p>
  <p>3. Definitions and theorems should always be stated clearly, precisely, and concisely.</p>
  <p>4. Do not try to give all the details of a proof unless it involves useful techniques or it is very interesting. Just sketch the main line of thought.</p>
  <p>5. Be prepared to answer and discuss any question posed by the audience.</p>
  <p>6. For effective learning, English should be used as much as possible, at least for the blackboard writing.</p>
