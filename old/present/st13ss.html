<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
For those who want to major in mathematics, set theory is a good place to start.
This gives you more insight into what mathematics is all about. 
It gives you a good training in logical and abstract thinking. 
It also provides you the precise definitions of some of the most often used concepts in mathematics, 
such as function, equivalence relation, binary operation, and ordinal and cardinal numbers. 
</p>

<p>Set theory is a relatively new field in modern mathematics. It serves as a foundation of
   mathematics. In this seminar, we will study the ZFC axioms of set theory, and learn how 
   to formalize objects in mathematics(such as the natural and real numbers) in this axiomatic
   system. Some fundamentals of algebra and topology will also be covered.
   (These parts may be eliminated since in past set theory seminars, we usually did not have enough
   time for the last chapter on transfinite induction) 
</p>

<p>
   This is an introductory seminar to set theory. Advanced topics in set theory,
   such as Goedel's Completeness and Incompleteness Theorem, the independence proofs and large cardinals, will not be mentioned,
   because they are irrelevant to everything you will learn in undergraduate level.
   Unfortunately, no one in China is studying set theory, although it is very interesting and
   worth studying.
